Dongwei Zhang is a doctor of organic geochemistry at the key laboratory of petroleum resources, Gansu Province. His research interests include chemical reaction kinetics, non-standard instrument automation and C++ development. He is committed to oil and gas exploration in the deep water area of the northern South China Sea. The team independently developed experimental instruments for simulating the generation of oil and gas under high temperature and pressure, established a mathematical model of hydrocarbon generation dynamics, and developed embedded software.
